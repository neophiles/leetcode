# My LeetCode Solutions

A personal documentation of my growth in data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving skills.


## About This Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each problem is organized in its own folder and includes:
- problem summary
- intuition behind the solution
- algorithm breakdown
- time and space complexity
- code implementation

I created this repo to track my growth in data structures, algorithms, and clean coding practices.


## Progress

- Languages: `TypeScript`
  
- Topics covered: `Arrays`, `Prefix Sum`, `Matrix`

- Topics to practice next: `Two Pointers`, `HashMaps`, `Sets`, `Binary Search`, `Recursion`, `Dynamic Programming`, `Trees`, `Graphs`
